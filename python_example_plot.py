python_example_plot.py

Demonstrate use of axidraw module in "plot" mode, to plot an SVG file.

Run this demo by calling: python python_example_plot.py


This is a minimal example to show how one can import the AxiDraw module
and use it to plot an SVG file with the AxiDraw.

(There is also a separate "interactive" mode, which can be used for moving
the AxiDraw to various points upon command, rather than plotting an SVG file.)
