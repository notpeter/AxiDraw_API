'''
Primary user-adjustable control parameters:

We encourage you to freely tune these values as needed to match the
 behavior and performance of your AxiDraw to your application and taste.

These parameters are used as defaults when using AxiDraw with the command-
 line interface (CLI) or with the python library. With the CLI, you can
 make copies of this configuration file and specify a configuration file.

If you are operating the AxiDraw from within Inkscape, please set your
 preferences within Inkscape, using the AxiDraw Control dialog.
 Most values listed here are ignored when running within Inkscape.
 
Similarly, values set within Inkscape are ignored when using the CLI or
 python library.
