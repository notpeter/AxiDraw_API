AxiDraw CLI and Python API — Installation

Supported on python 2.7, python 3.6, 
Mac, Windows, and Linux.


—————————————————————————————————————————
INSTALLATION

1. Installing python

Macs and linux boxes usually have python pre-installed.

If you are on Windows, you'll probably not already have this on your computer. 
Go to: https://www.python.org/download/

If you have a choice, we highly recommend installing python 3.6 or newer. :)

2. Installing pip

python versions 2.7.9+ and 3.4+ come with pip pre-installed.

If you do not have pip, see the extended instructions below for instructions on how to install it.

3. Installing pyaxidraw

Unzip the archive and move into the folder:

```
cd /Users/username/Documents/axidraw-api/  (Your location and path will vary)
```

Then use pip to install it.

To use all the latest versions of the dependencies:

```
pip install .
```

To use a known working set of versions:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Test that the software is operational:

A (very simple) sample file is included. You can plot it with the
following command line:

python axicli.py AxiDraw_trivial.svg

If everything is set up correctly, this should plot the SVG file, which contains a single object.

GETTING STARTED

* Getting started with the command-line interface:
You can get additional documentation and command-line usage options by using
    python axicli.py --help
or refer to the full documentation, at: https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/

* Getting started with the python API:
Two example python scripts are included. See README.txt for instructions.
For the full python API documentation, please see: https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/

________________________________________
TROUBLESHOOTING

(A) If you get the error “The fantastic lxml wrapper for libxml2 is required [...]”,
then you do not have lxml installed. See the instructions above.

(B) If you get the error "ImportError: No module named pyserial", then you do not have pyserial installed. See the instructions above.

(C) If you get the error "Failed to connect to AxiDraw", then your computer cannot locate the AxiDraw via USB. Check that it's plugged in.

If you do not have an AxiDraw in front of you, you can still use various offline functions. The following will render a preview of how the file will plot, and report the time that it will take to plot, even with no AxiDraw machine present:

python axicli.py AxiDraw_trivial.svg -Tvg3 -o outputfile.svg

DETAILED/OLD INSTRUCTIONS

If you don't already have pip installed or want to install dependencies manually, you may find the following helpful.

Recommended procedures for installing pyserial and lxml:

(A) Mac Users:

From the terminal, enter these three lines, providing password when requested:
sudo easy_install pip
xcode-select --install
sudo -H pip install pyserial
sudo -H pip install lxml


Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html


(B) Windows Users:

Install PIP on your computer, following the instructors here:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

You may need to open your command prompt with a right-click and "Run as administrator" in order to avoid permissions errors.

Then, 
python -m pip install pyserial
python -m pip install lxml



If you run into difficulties with installing lxml, you may prefer to start with precompiled binaries for your particular version of Windows and Python.

Download the appropriate "WHL" file for your version of
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml

* For a typical modern Windows 10 computer running python 2.7, the download might be something similar to: lxml‑3.7.3‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl

* For a typical modern Windows 10 computer running python 3.6, the download might be something similar to: lxml‑3.7.3‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl


Once you have this "whl" package downloaded, you can install it with:
python -m pip install some-package.whl

(As before, you may need to run your command prompt as administrator.)

Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html

(C) Linux Users

 Install PIP on your computer, following the instructors here:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Then, use:
  pip install pyserial
  pip install lxml

Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
