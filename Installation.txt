AxiDraw CLI and Python API — Installation

Supported on python 2.7, python 3.6, 
Mac, Windows, and Linux.


—————————————————————————————————————————
INSTALLATION

1.) Install python

Macs and linux boxes usually have python pre-installed.

If you are on Windows, you'll probably not already have this on your computer. 
Go to: https://www.python.org/download/

If you have a choice, we highly recommend installing python 3.6 or newer. :)


2.) Install pip

python versions 2.7.9+ and 3.4+ come with pip pre-installed.

If you do not have pip, download and install it, following the instructions at:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/


3.) [Optional:] Use virtualenv to control versioning

This is a particularly good idea if you are using the python API or want to be able to run this software in both pythons 2 and 3.

Install virtualenv:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual python environment:

```
virtualenv -p $(which python3) venv
```

This creates a directory called `venv` which contains the files for the new environment.
Replace `python3` with the name of the python on your system you want to use, e.g. `python2`, `python2.7`, `python3.5`, `python3.6`, etc.

Enter the environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now your command prompt should be prefixed with "(venv)", indicating that you are now in the virtual environment you created.
You can now continue as normal.

4). Install this software (pyaxidraw and axicli)

Unzip the archive and move into the folder:

```
cd /Users/username/Documents/axidraw-api/  (Your location and path will vary)
```

Then use pip to install it.

To use all the latest versions of the dependencies:

```
pip install .
```

(On Windows, you may need to use "python -m pip install .")


To use a known working set of versions:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


5.) Test that the software is operational:

A (very simple) sample file is included. You can plot it with the following command line:

axicli test/assets/AxiDraw_trivial.svg

If everything is set up correctly, this should plot the SVG file, which contains a very simple drawing.



—————————————————————————————————————————
GETTING STARTED

* Getting started with the command-line interface:
You can get additional documentation and command-line usage options by using
    axicli --help
or refer to the full documentation, at: https://axidraw.com/doc/cli_api/

An example file is included. To plot it, use:
    axicli test/assets/AxiDraw_trivial.svg

* Getting started with the python API:
Two example python scripts are included. See README.txt for instructions.
For the full python API documentation, please see: https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/


________________________________________
TROUBLESHOOTING

(A) If you get errors (especially on Windows) indicating that axicli is not a recognized command, you may need to use
    python -m axicli <input> 
instead. You can add the python scripts directory to your system path in order to use axicli directly.

(B) If you get the error “The fantastic lxml wrapper for libxml2 is required [...]”,
then you do not have lxml installed. See supplementary instructions below and/or contact technical support.

(C) If you get the error "ImportError: No module named pyserial", then you do not have pyserial installed.

(D) If you get the error "Failed to connect to AxiDraw", then your computer cannot locate the AxiDraw via USB. Check that it's plugged in.

If you do not have an AxiDraw in front of you, you can still use various offline functions. The following will render a preview of how the file will plot, and report the time that it will take to plot, even with no AxiDraw machine present:

axicli test/assets/AxiDraw_trivial.svg -Tvg3 -o outputfile.svg



_________________________________________
UNINSTALLING

If you used `virtualenv` (step 3), uninstalling is as simple as leaving the virtual environment.
The easiest way to do that is to close your terminal.

If you did not use `virtualenv`, use pip to uninstall:

```
pip uninstall pyaxidraw
```

You may also want to uninstall pyaxidraw's dependencies, assuming you aren't using them for anything else:

```
pip uninstall ink_extensions lxml pyserial
```

SUPPLEMENTARY INSTRUCTIONS

If you don't already have pip installed or want to install dependencies manually, you may find the following helpful.

Recommended procedures for installing this software:

(A) Mac Users:

From the terminal, enter these three, providing password when requested:
sudo easy_install pip
xcode-select --install

Then, in the AxiDraw API directory: 
sudo -H pip install .


Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html


(B) Windows Users:

Install PIP on your computer, following the instructors here:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/


If pip is not directly accessible with the command 'pip' after installation, you may need to use:

python -m pip install .

You may need to open your command prompt with a right-click and "Run as administrator" in order to avoid permissions errors.


If you run into difficulties with installing lxml, you may prefer to start with precompiled binaries for your particular version of Windows and Python.

Download the appropriate "WHL" file for your version of
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml

* For a typical modern Windows 10 computer running python 2.7, the download might be something similar to: lxml‑3.7.3‑cp27‑cp27m‑win_amd64.whl

* For a typical modern Windows 10 computer running python 3.6, the download might be something similar to: lxml‑3.7.3‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl


Once you have this "whl" package downloaded, you can install it with:
python -m pip install some-package.whl

(As before, you may need to run your command prompt as administrator.)

Additional help for lxml installation is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html


(C) Linux Users

Install PIP on your computer, following the instructors here:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

If you run into difficulty with the lxml installation, additional is available here:
http://lxml.de/installation.html
